* Installation

The first step for installing this plugin is including it in a zip file:

~zip bae-mastermind-service.zip package.json mastermind-plugin.py mastermindschema.py keystone_client.py~

Next you need to install some dependencies in your charging backend Django server in order to load the plugin:

~pip install jsonschema pyyaml~

In order to grant permission to use MasterMind with the IdM you need to register a new role for the MasterMind application (the ~owner~ role),
and also register MasterMind in the IdM with the MasterMind's API URL (by default ~:3000~).
* Loading the plugin
Then, load the plugin into the platform using the ~loadplugin~ command of your Business Ecosystem Charging Backend.

~./manage.py loadplugin /path/to/your/plugin/bae-mastermind-service.zip~
